Welcome to my blog! I'm a student interested in **machine learning** and
**programming languages**. Currently, I'm making machine learning inference
faster at **NVIDIA** ([TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)), 
conducting research in differential privacy with **Prof. Gautam Kamath**, and
studying Computer Science & Statistics at the **University of Waterloo**.

Previously, I did deep learning research on collaborative self-driving at
**Uber ATG**, helped improve the neural network optimization algorithm
[K-FAC](https://github.com/tensorflow/kfac) at **Google Brain**, and developed
data-driven models to identify fraud at **John Hancock Financial**. I've also
worked as a Research Assistant for **Prof. Lin Tan** in deep learning-driven
software analysis and **Prof. Pascal Poupart** on neural network parameter
learning.
