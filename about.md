Welcome to my blog! I'm a student interested in **machine learning** and
**programming languages**. Currently, I'm making machine learning inference
faster at **NVIDIA** ([TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)) and
studying Computer Science & Statistics at the **University of Waterloo**.

Previously, I did deep learning research on collaborative self-driving at
**Uber ATG**, helped improve the neural network optimization algorithm
[K-FAC](https://github.com/tensorflow/kfac) at **Google Brain**, and developed
data-driven models to identify fraud at **John Hancock Financial**.

You can reach me at `nicholas.vadivelu [at] gmail [dot] com`. If you love
tidbits of technical info, follow me on

some of my data science [workshops](https://github.com/n2cholas/dsc-workshops)!
