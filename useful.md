Collection of useful links/resources/stuff.

## Misc.
- [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), a course from MIT that teaches a bunch of useful stuff you'd wish you'd learned sooner, like shell (+ scripting), editors, data processing, version control (git), debugging, and more.
- [How to read a paper](https://youtu.be/733m6qBH-jI), some nice advice from Andrew Ng on reading papers as well as finding a career in ML.
- [LaTeX Design Patterns](https://www.gleave.me/post/latex-design-patterns/), made me much more productive in LaTeX.

## Talks
- [Advanced Numpy](https://youtu.be/cYugp9IN1-Q), really really really good workshop by Juan Nunuz-Iglesias on advanced numpy, particularly stride tricks.
- [Automatic Differentiation](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2017_johnson_automatic_differentiation/), nice talk by Matthew Johnson about how autodiff works, plus the basics of the autograd library.

## Tools
- [VSCode Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share), a real game-changer for pair programming.
- [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) a super underrated python CLI building tool. For simple applications (i.e. everything I write), you can't get more succinct than this library.
