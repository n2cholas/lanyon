## What impact do you want to have on the world and why?

Machine learning and AI drive a large proportion of the products we use everyday; however, the biases, robustness, and safety of these algorithms are not critically examined. This is understandable--investing in debiasing, robustness, and safety don’t drive near-term profits. My goal is to help businesses augment their machine learning systems to be more robust, which is attractive for their profits, while ensuring these systems mitigate biases, incorporate diverse perspectives, and promote safety.

To achieve this, I am currently conducting research in the area of differential privacy, and plan to conduct research in other critical areas like machine learning fairness, interpretability, and more. After building the new algorithms and methods needed for fair machine learning systems, I want to start a company to apply these methods in practice.

Through my experience, I’ve learned that research alone won’t change the world and existing solutions aren’t fitting the bill, so I hope to do both and really make an impact.

## Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.
Creating my YouTube Channel ([youtube.com/cramboom](https://www.youtube.com/user/CramBoom)) 7 years ago shaped the interests, values, and drive I have today.

I researched, scripted, recorded, edited, and monetized educational science videos through my YouTube channel, amassing almost 1000 subscribers and 300k views. I still remember my inspiration for creating the first video: my vision was getting worse every year and I was frantically searching for a way to stop the plummet. I read online that carrots _don’t actually improve the sharpness of your vision_. This blew my mind, and I knew I needed to share this with the world, so I created my first real YouTube video explaining why people need eyeglasses and why carrots don’t help. It was extremely challenging--it took me dozens of tries to even produce a coherent recording! But after this, I was hooked: I loved learning then sharing that knowledge with the world. Though I no longer create videos, I still strive to discover new knowledge through my research and share that knowledge to the world through workshops, blog posts, and papers.

Through monetizing my videos, I made a whopping $200 (which was a lot for grade 8 me). Being able to productize my passion was mind boggling for me, and inevitably shaped my career--I knew I could do something I loved, positively impact people’s lives, and still make money through the process.

Without my brief YouTube career, I wouldn’t be passionate about discovering novel fair ML methods and bringing them to businesses like I am today.
